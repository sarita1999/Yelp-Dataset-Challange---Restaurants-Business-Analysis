# Business Analysis in Restaurants - Yelp Dataset Challenge

 This paper uses text mining and NLP to fully 
understand the Restaurant Reviews and their rating 
correlations from Yelp Dataset. Furthermore, sentiment 
analysis and Topic Modelling will help extract the crucial 
topics/aspects that influence a restaurant to get a 5-star or a 1-
star rating. The topic modelling will help us connect words 
with similar meanings and distinguish between uses of words 
with multiple meanings in our review corpus. We will use the 
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) method. Later, we will see a 
double coherence score improvement by applying TF-IDF. 
These all combined helped us understand that many 
restaurants obtain more than four stars because most reviews 
are classified with high polarity. What is surprising is that the 
topics with one-star ratings are very similar to the ones with 
five stars ratings. That indicates that those topics mentioned in 
the Findings are crucial to determine the success or failure of a 
Restaurant.
